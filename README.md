##Examples of the solution the interesting tasks

1. The task is to create a composite function.See [functionComposition.py]
(https://github.com/shevchykH/automation-qa/blob/master/taskSolution/mergedStringChecker.py)
compose(f , g)(x)
=> f( g( x ) ).

2. Write an algorithm to check if a given string, s, can be formed from two other strings, part1 and part2.
The restriction is that the characters in part1 and part2 are in the same order as in s. See mergedStringChecker.py
Example:
s: d o l l a r = dollar
part1: d l r = dlr
part2: o l a  = ola
